## Lesson Creation

I would love to have people submit proposals for lessons that can be added to the website. However, since there is a large amount of work between creating the lesson, having it reviewed and adding the necessary code to the project, lessons will have to first be looked about by the community for approval first. The content and design of the lesson should then be submitted. Developement of the lesson can then be broken down into different issues before actual work is done for it.
